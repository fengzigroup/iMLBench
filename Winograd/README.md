## Winograd convolution (Winograd)

Winograd convolution (Winograd) is a kind of convolution algorithm that is used to accelerate convolutions with popular 3×3 filters. It employs the Winograd minimal filtering algorithm which reduces the arithmetic complexity by at least 2.25×, thus resulting in significant time and energy savings. We implement Winograd convolution based on [“Fast Algorithms for Convolutional Neural Networks. ” In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016]
